# Flashback (REminiscence)

## Background

Stuart Carnie has ported REminiscence ,Gregory Montoir’s Flashback emulator, over to libretro! REminiscence is a game engine recreation of the 1992/1993 action adventure game Flashback. It is the spiritual successor of Another World/Out Of This World and it distinguishes itself with rotoscoped graphics, polygonal cutscenes, and a Prince of Persia-style gameplay system.

This port is still a work in progress, however it is in a working state. Currently, it jumps directly into the game, skipping the main menu.

We have also added modplug support to the core for improved music playback.

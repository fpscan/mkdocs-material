# Handheld Electronic (GW)

## Background

A libretro core for Game & Watch simulators.

It runs simulators converted from source code for the games available at [MADrigal](http://www.madrigaldesign.it/sim/).

#### How to start the GW core:

- As an example showcasing loading content with GW core, we will load the Donkey Kong (Coleco) game hosted on RetroArch's Content Downloader.

You can do this by going to RetroArch's main menu screen and selecting 'Online Updater'. From there, select 'Content Downloader'.

<center> ![](/image/core/alldownload.png) </center>

- Select 'Handheld Electronic Game', then select 'Donkey Kong (Coleco)'. This should download and extract this file to RetroArch's Downloads directory.

- Select 'Donkey Kong (Coleco).mgw'.

- If you are asked which core to select, choose 'Handheld Electronic (GW)'.

The content should now start running!

## Core options

The Gearboy core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded. 

Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **Emulated Model (restart)** [gearboy_model] (**Auto**|Game Boy DMG)

	Select which hardware/model is emulated.

    - Auto selects the best hardware based in the rom.
    - Game Boy DMG forces original Game Boy hardware.

- **Palette** [gearboy_palette] (**Original**|Sharp|B/W|Autumn|Soft|Slime)

	Select a color palette for Game Boy DMG games.
	
- **Allow Up+Down / Left+Right** [gearboy_up_down_allowed] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

	Enabling this will allow pressing / quickly alternating / holding both left and right (or up and down in some games) directions at the same time. 
	
	This may cause movement based glitches to occur in certain games.
	
	It's best to keep this core option disabled.
